## The Problem

India logged **1.14 million cybercrime complaints in 2023** — up 60% year-on-year. "Digital arrest" scams alone cost citizens over **₹1,776 crore in nine months of 2024**. RBI's 2025 report flagged record counterfeit currency seizures, with fakes now sophisticated enough to defeat manual bank checks.

The real failure isn't lack of evidence after a crime — it's lack of intelligence before mass victimisation. Most fraud-detection tools work in isolation; a scam detector doesn't talk to a graph-analysis tool, which doesn't talk to a currency scanner.

## The Solution

**SENTINEL** connects four AI modules through a single shared intelligence layer. Every threat caught by a citizen-facing tool automatically strengthens a law-enforcement investigation tool — in real time, with zero manual cross-referencing.

## Modules

### SCAMWatch — Citizen Scam Detection

Real-time scam message analysis powered by a 5-node LangGraph pipeline. A zero-cost rule-based pre-classifier flags obvious signals, then Groq Llama 3.3 70B performs deep semantic analysis followed by structured risk scoring.

**Scam Types:** Digital Arrest | Fake KYC | Fake Investment | Fake Job | Fake Lottery | Impersonation | Romance

**Languages:** English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu

**Accuracy:** 85% detection, 0 false positives across 20 sample cases

**Features:**
- Plain-language verdict with recommended actions
- One-click File Complaint (cybercrime.gov.in)
- One-click Number Block (Sanchar Saathi / TRAI)
- Citizen Alert with emergency contacts (1930, cybercrime.gov.in)
- Structured MHA-shaped alert payload

```
Input Text → Rule-Based Classification → LLM Semantic Analysis → Risk Scoring → Intelligence Store
```

---

### CURRENCYGuard — Currency Authentication

Computer-vision pipeline running 7 OpenCV security checks with a dedicated play-money detector that flags obvious fakes before deeper analysis (cost-efficient design).

**Security Checks:** Image Quality | Aspect Ratio | Color Distribution | Security Thread | Serial Number | Watermark Region | Print Sharpness

**Supported Denominations:** ₹50, ₹100, ₹200, ₹500, ₹2000

**Verdicts:** GENUINE | SUSPECT | COUNTERFEIT | INCONCLUSIVE

**Features:**
- Downloadable PDF authenticity report
- Play money pre-screening
- Hybrid rule+CV+LLM pipeline

```
Currency Image → OpenCV Feature Analysis → LLM Expert Reasoning → Authenticity Report → Intelligence Store
```

---

### FRAUDGraph — Fraud Network Mapping

Graph-AI engine for analysing organised financial crime. Extracts entities from structured input and free-text victim statements (LLM-powered extraction from unstructured narrative).

**Entity Types:** Phone Numbers | Bank Accounts | Devices | Victims | Locations

**Analysis:** Connected components + betweenness centrality fraud ring detection

**Evidence Kit (ZIP):**
- PDF intelligence report
- Interactive graph visualization (HTML)
- Entity inventory (CSV)
- Raw analysis data (JSON)
- Manifest citing IT Act 2000 and DPDP Act 2023

```
Evidence → Entity Extraction → Graph Construction → Cluster Detection → Intelligence Summary → Court-Admissible Report
```

---

### GeoIntel — Geospatial Intelligence

Maps live incidents from all three modules onto real, publicly-reported NCRB/RBI/MHA fraud and counterfeit hotspot regions across India.

**15 Hotspot Locations:** Jamtara, Mewat, Deoghar, major metros, and other NCRB/RBI/MHA-flagged regions

**Features:**
- Pydeck heatmap with dark theme
- Filterable by module and risk level
- Geographic intelligence picture from individual reports

---

### WhatsApp Shield — Chat-Based Detection

A WhatsApp-styled chat interface that lets citizens interact with SCAMWatch conversationally — same backend, familiar channel.

- WhatsApp-style UI
- Real-time analysis via SCAMWatch API
- 4 sample scam messages for demo

---

### Intelligence Dashboard — Cross-Module Analytics

The platform's signature view: turns individual reports into a unified threat intelligence picture.

- Live Threat Monitor with detection timeline chart
- Cross-module correlation alerts
- Real-time activity feed
- Module health checks

**Key Correlation:** A phone number flagged independently in a citizen's SCAMWatch report and a police FRAUDGraph investigation surfaces as an automatic correlation alert — a connection a human analyst would otherwise have to find by hand.

## Engineering Design Decisions

**Hybrid rule+LLM pipelines** — Cheap deterministic checks run before expensive LLM calls, keeping cost per analysis minimal while maintaining accuracy.

**Graceful degradation** — Neo4j falls back to in-memory NetworkX graph. LLM failures return safe fallback messages instead of crashing. Every module works independently even if shared infrastructure is unavailable.

**Shared intelligence layer** — All modules write to a single ChromaDB vector store. A phone number flagged in SCAMWatch automatically strengthens a FRAUDGraph investigation — zero manual cross-referencing.

**Typed Pydantic models end-to-end** — Structured data contracts between all layers, preventing silent data-shape bugs.

**CPU-inference, zero GPU dependency** — Runs on 8GB RAM. Built to be realistically deployable, not just demo-able.

---

## Scope Transparency

SENTINEL is honest about what it is and isn't:

- **Voice-spoofing and deepfake-image detection** are architecture placeholders, not trained classifiers — flagged transparently in-product rather than overclaimed.
- **WhatsApp/IVR integration** is a functional simulation (identical backend, mocked channel) rather than a live Meta/telecom API integration — a deliberate scope choice given hackathon constraints.
- **Neo4j** runs with graceful in-memory fallback when the graph database isn't available — full functionality preserved.

---

## Test Results

```
Accuracy:  85% scam detection (0 false positives)
Languages: 5 (English, Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu)
Hotspots:  15 (NCRB/RBI/MHA flagged regions)
Scam Types: 7
CV Checks:  7 (OpenCV security feature analysis)
```

---

## Future Roadmap

- Voice scam detection (audio analysis pipeline)
- Deepfake image detection (GAN-generated currency imagery)
- OCR for FIR document processing
- Real-time WhatsApp/Telegram bot integration
- Multi-language expansion (Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi)
- Real-time alert streaming via WebSockets
- Government intelligence API integration
- Mobile application (React Native)
- Federated threat intelligence across jurisdictions
